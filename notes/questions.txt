1. On the website of glove they say that no one number indicators can really capture the difference between words. They propose using the vector difference instead. However in order to map we need one single point. 
2. On https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/99171/why-is-euclidean-distance-not-a-good-metric-in-high-dimensions they argue than the eucledian distance which I am using is not a good measure when dealing with high dimensional vectors which is the case here.
3. I have an idea to use several words at once and then combine their score instead of using single words. For example the words organized, coordinated, formulated, standardized all have very similiar meanings. Instead of computing the distance for the word organized only one could compute the distance for all synonyms of the word too and then take the average. 
4. Right now we can only map single objects. Any ideas how we can map full sentences for example? Most psychological tests are based on giving the participants a sentence and then ask them their opinion using the likert scale. One possible idea is to use sequence prediction. We give the algorithm the sentence and then measure how likely the word like or dislike would follow the sentence.
